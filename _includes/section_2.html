    <p>
        That's entirely up to you. You could work on sustainability-themed hacks, or work on your own personal projects. You can work solo, or you can work in pairs/teams with your friends, or people you've met on the day.

        If you've got any project ideas already, you can describe them in the field on the sign-up form, so that we've got a nice list of projects to inspire people on the day.
